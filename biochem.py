  1. organisms have higher chemical complexities: 
    "meaning every thousad molecules make up cells internal structure and every organell with specific chemical subunits"
  2. Orgnaisma have a systems for energy extraction, tranformation, and.consumption:
    therefore: :
        : "enables them build,maintain and perform chemical actions,osmotic & electrical work : :
          however: the in non-living organisms, the life sequence tend to decay in a more disordersed state to enhance equilibrium in the sorounding.
  3. Capacity for:
   "pricise Self-replication & Assembly: :"
  #high and low level organisms,for. bacteria_cells placed in sterile nutrient mediums give rise to billion identical cells.
 # similarly the bactriums have identical copies of the parents.
  4. Sensory and response : organism have a costant adjustment system to their environment.
  5. def functions:
    living organisms.have. componetns with specific functions and that controls the interraction of these componets.
    #both microscopic and structures with intracellular with indivudual chemical componets interact internally
    this is significant for both animals and plants.

      {"(interplays between chemical components of a living orgnaisms are dynamic:
       and the changes in one component activate and cordinate another process thus a system of 
       cordinated programmes)"}
  6. orgarnisms also have evolutionary changes:
       "new environments elicits new adaptive meacsures:" or
       "new characteristics"
